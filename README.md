## Notification Microservice-based on NestJS

### About the project

This is an notification microservice based Microservice Architecture with NestJS. It uses NodeJS, so you need to have NodeJS installed on your machine. Also used and recommend [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) to test the API endpoints.

### Some information about the project

- Project uses [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) as framework
- Project uses [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) as runtime environment
- Project uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as language

### How to run and test the project

- Clone this repository
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- Run `npm run start:dev` to start the server in development mode
- Run `npm run test` to run the tests / `npm run test:watch` to run the tests in watch mode
- If you want to run the project in production mode, run `npm run build` and then `npm run start:prod`
- Use [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) or another one that you usually do, to test the API endpoints
- Use KafkaJS to test the message broker

### Kafka-Producer

- I also created a new folder just typed `npm init` and then `npm install kafkajs` and then I created a file called `producer.js`. In this file I created a producer following the documentation of KafkaJS. Then just run `node producer.js` and you can see the messages in the terminal where the project is running like an Consumer.
